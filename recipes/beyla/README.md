# eBPF HTTP Observability with Beyla

This recipe demonstrates how to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector
(as deployed by the Operator) to send [Beyla](https://github.com/grafana/beyla)
metric and trace data to GCP [Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) and
[Google Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus).

In this recipe, Beyla is configured to collect http metrics and traces from all
workloads in the cluster without any code changes. Beyla has other features,
such as auto-instrumentation for Go applications, but this sample does not use
it for that purpose.

This recipe is based on applying a Collector config that enables the Google Cloud exporter.
It provides an `OpenTelemetryCollector` object that, when created, instructs the Operator to
create a new instance of the Collector with that config. If overwriting an existing `OpenTelemetryCollector`
object (i.e., you already have a running Collector through the Operator such as the one from the
[main README](../../README.md#starting-the-collector)), the Operator will update that existing
Collector with the new config.


## Prerequisites

[!WARNING]  
Beyla only works with GKE standard clusters, because GKE Auto restricts the use of privileged pods.

* Cloud Trace and Cloud Monitoring APIs enabled in your GCP project
* The `roles/cloudtrace.agent` and `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
  [IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/iam#roles)
  for your cluster's service account (or Workload Identity setup as shown below).
* A running (non-autopilot) GKE cluster
* The OpenTelemetry Operator installed in your cluster
* A Collector deployed with the Operator (recommended) or a ServiceAccount that can be used by the new Collector.
  * Note: This recipe assumes that you already have a Collector ServiceAccount named `otel-collector`,
    which is created by the operator when deploying an `OpenTelemetryCollector` object such as the
    one [in this repo](../../collector-config.yaml).
* An application already deployed that makes or serves HTTP requests:
  * Note: Beyla does not currently support HTTPS or gRPC
  * [One of the sample apps](../../sample-apps) from this repo, without auto-instrumentation enabled.

Note that the `OpenTelemetryCollector` object needs to be in the same namespace as your sample
app, or the Collector endpoint needs to be updated to point to the correct service address.

## Running

### Workload Identity Setup

If you have Workload Identity enabled, you'll need to set up a service account with permission to
write traces to Cloud Trace. You can do this with the following commands:

```
export GCLOUD_PROJECT=<your GCP project ID>
gcloud iam service-accounts create otel-collector --project=${GCLOUD_PROJECT}
```

Then give that service account permission to write traces and metrics:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCLOUD_PROJECT \
    --member "serviceAccount:otel-collector@${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role "roles/cloudtrace.agent"
```

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCLOUD_PROJECT \
    --member "serviceAccount:otel-collector@${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role "roles/monitoring.metricWriter"
```

Then bind the GCP service account to the Kubernetes ServiceAccount that is used by the Collector
you deployed in the prerequisites (note: set `$COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE` to the namespace you installed
the Collector in):

```
export COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE=default
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "otel-collector@${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
    --member "serviceAccount:${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE}/otel-collector]"
```

**(Optional):** If you don't already have a ServiceAccount for the Collector (such as the one provided
when deploying a prior OpenTelemetryCollector object), create it with `kubectl create serviceaccount otel-collector`.

Finally, annotate the Collector's ServiceAccount to use Workload Identity:

```
kubectl annotate serviceaccount otel-collector \
    --namespace $COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE \
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=otel-collector@${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Deploying the Recipe

Apply the `OpenTelemetryCollector` object from this recipe:

```
kubectl apply -f collector-config.yaml
```

(This will overwrite any existing collector config, or create a new one if none exists.)

Once the Collector restarts, apply the Beyla Daemonset:

```
kubectl apply -f beyla-daemonset.yaml
```

This will begin creating metrics and traces for all http traffic on each node,
and exporting them to Google Cloud.

## View your Spans and Metrics

Navigate to the Trace explorer and view the traces created by Beyla.

Navigate to the Metrics explorer and look for the `http_server_duration` and
`http_client_duration` metrics.

## Troubleshooting

### rpc error: code = PermissionDenied

An error such as the following:

```
2022/10/21 13:41:11 failed to export to Google Cloud Trace: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = The caller does not have permission
```

This indicates that your Collector is unable to export spans, likely due to misconfigured IAM. Things to check:

#### GKE (cluster-side) config issues

With some configurations it's possible that the Operator could overwrite an existing ServiceAccount when deploying
a new Collector. Ensure that the Collector's service account has the `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` annotation after
running the `kubectl apply...` command in [Deploying the Recipe](#deploying-the-recipe). If this is missing, re-run the
`kubectl annotate` command to add it to the ServiceAccount and restart the Collector Pod by deleting it (`kubectl delete pod/otel-collector-xxx..`).

#### GCP (project-side) config issues

Double check that IAM is properly configured for Cloud Trace access. This includes:

* Verify the `otel-collector` service account exists in your GCP project
* That service account must have `roles/cloudtrace.agent` permissions
* The `serviceAccount:${GCLOUD_PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE}/otel-collector]` member must also be bound
  to the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role (this identifies the Kubernetes ServiceAccount as able to use Workload Identity)
